## AI Usage Declaration

### Project Name
Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer (Android)

### AI Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- Gemini (Google)

### Purpose of AI Usage
During the development of this project, artificial intelligence tools were used strictly as **supportive resources** in the following specific areas:

- **Syntax Assistance:**  
  Verification of correct Java syntax for data structures such as `PriorityQueue` and `Comparator`.

- **Android Boilerplate Support:**  
  Assistance in generating initial Android XML layout templates and RecyclerView adapter structures during the grid interface design phase.

- **Debugging Support:**  
  Analysis of potential causes of issues such as infinite loops and `NullPointerException` errors encountered during the implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm.

- **Documentation Support:**  
  Structuring the project’s README file in an academic format and verifying the correctness of technical English terminology.

### Human Contribution
The architectural design and logical integrity of the project were entirely developed by the authors:

- **Core Logic:**  
  The core structure of the project, including the graph data model, adjacency list design, and `Node` class architecture, was fully designed and implemented by the authors.

- **Algorithm Integration:**  
  Any code fragments suggested by AI tools were **not copied directly**. Instead, they were adapted, rewritten, and integrated in accordance with the project’s variable naming conventions and overall class architecture.

- **Testing and Validation:**  
  The correctness of the algorithms (BFS and Dijkstra) was validated through manually designed test scenarios, ensuring proper pathfinding behavior around obstacles.

### Restrictions
- AI-generated code was not incorporated into the project without fully understanding its underlying logic.
- No complete or substantial sections of code were copied in a manner that would compromise the originality of the project.
